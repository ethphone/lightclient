ethereum.phone for light clients

At a time when decentralization has become more important as
Ethe 2.0 becomes PoS , the project aims to
lower the barriers of the general public's blockchain with mobile devices that are faithful to decentralization
and added to blockchain functions by operating nodes on inexpensive devices
We have set up and operated the
Geth Embedded Light Node, and we have been designing and producing
custom Embedded Light Node. In order to develop an Etherium Phone that can operate Gesnode in the form
of a Blockchain Phone, we are currently developing a Blockchain Phone by purchasing Galaxy S8/Samsung
Exynos8895 Development Board, Mate 10/ Huway Kirin970 Development Board, and One Plus 5T/Qualcomm
Snapdragon 845 Development Board.
Along
with Embedded Light, Eth node will be created with Ethereum Phone to contribute to the Ethereum
ecosystem that pursues decentralized nodes.
It aims to implement a staging node in a low
cost/low power Ethereum Phone for eth2.0 switching to PoS.
Ubuntu OS is a Devian affiliated Linux OS that has been used by people all around the world.
The ambitious "Ubuntu for Phone" and "
UbuntuTouch " projects, which were aimed at porting smartphones in
2017, were unfortunately stranded, but the Delta team came to consider eth light client operating on an
embed linux based phone to spread the block chain full node in the mobile environment, and a true wide
range of true wide fields
In
addition, Linux based mobile phone OS and interface of Mobile Modem (LTE) are fortunately provided with
RIL drivers that support open source Linux, enabling transplants if you focus on related development
documents and porting
Light Client development, which utilizes basic
WiFI , is expected to take three months in development mode.
The development period is estimated to be about one year before optimizing the mobile communication
modem interface, launcher, and OTA, and the long term road map will be prepared and carried out..
